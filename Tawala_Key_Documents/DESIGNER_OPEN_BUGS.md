## Active / deferred bugs

### Deploy data isolation (Jul 22 Safari smoke)

- **Symptom:** Safari multi-app smoke looked like “projects sharing data” (signups / form UI from one app showing up in another).
- **Findings:**
  1. **DB rows are per `Project` id** — emails did **not** cross uniqueIds in a scrape of Signup / Survey / Potluck lists.
  2. **`Simple Survey` Deploy (`qyzju5cyuagbidj`) is contaminated** — page heading / form is **Sign-up Sheet Template**, while the MQL still lists older Form 1 survey-style rows. Classic **Redeploy-by-name**: Java `ProjectsHibernateImpl.put` reuses `UserProject` when **name** matches and **keeps submissions**.
  3. **Shared `JSESSIONID` on `localhost:8080`** — session `StoredContextInfo` key omitted `userProjectId`, so **concurrent Deploy tabs** could thrash in-progress edits across apps (Safari multi-tab is an easy trigger).
  4. **Main Menu template JSON was deleted** in the Jul 22 commit — Vite returned SPA HTML for `/samples/templates/*.json` (broken New Project starters). **Restored** under `designer-web/public/samples/templates/`.
- **Fixed (session):** `ExecutionContext.getStorageAttribute()` now appends `userProjectId`; class hot-copied into Tomcat Jul 22 evening.
- **Ops clean-up (Jul 22 evening):** Deleted contaminated Tomcat Deploy **`Simple Survey`** (`qyzju5cyuagbidj`) + its 7 submissions; see `CONTAMINATED_SIMPLE_SURVEY_JUL22.md`. Prefer **New Project** (not overwrite) between featured apps; Redeploy under a fresh name if lists look wrong.

### Preview / Deploy font size vs Design (Jul 23)

- **Symptom:** In Chrome / Safari / Edge, Form **Preview** and **Deploy** body text often looked larger than Design canvas (toolbar default **12 pt**; canvas unstyled text is **13px**).
- **Cause:** Preview `BASE_FORM_CSS` had **no** body `font-size` (browser default ~16px); Deploy `default.css` used **11pt** (~14.7px); Safari could also inflate via text-size-adjust. Starter templates often have **no** inline `font-size`, so they inherit the page base.
- **Fixed:** Preview + Deploy body/html **13px** + `text-size-adjust: 100%`; Preview inputs inherit. DirtBowl theme still uses its own 16px registration CSS. **Smoke:** hard-refresh Deploy (`default.css`); reopen Form Preview — instructional text / MQL should match Design size.
### Document functions (Jul 20)

- **Two identical MQL on Document 2 — different Deploy results** — One block showed `<>` (no table); the other rendered a table but the multi-select MCQ column (“All possibilities”) was blank. **Root cause (1):** formatting toolbar / styled wrapper `<span style="font-size…">` around a function token exported as nested `<font><font><itemization-table>…` — Java Font FACTORY drops the inner table. **Fixed:** `documentHtmlToXml.mjs` detects font-wrapped display components and skips the outer wrap. **Root cause (2):** multi-select MCQ values sometimes stored as one comma-separated string; Java `displayLabelsOnly` did not split them. **Fixed:** `DisplayMultipleChoiceLabel.java` splits comma-separated selections; Preview MQL uses `formatMcqCellValue` in `itemizationPreview.mjs`. **Owner OK Jul 20** after Tomcat WAR rebuild + Redeploy (re-entered one MQL manually).

- **Configure Function field target: Fields palette double-click does not replace** — **Fixed Jul 20.** Two causes: (1) Configure inputs live outside `.mdi-window.active`, so Fields double-click was refused as a “stale MDI target”; (2) column Contents / expression boxes appended at caret instead of replacing. Fix: `configureDialog` targets stay usable outside MDI + replace whole value on drop/double-click. **Smoke:** focus Contents or Where field → double-click a Fields leaf → prior value replaced (not appended / not no-op).

### File / Save

- **Save / Save As ignore last-loaded file name** — **Owner Passed Jul 20** (no longer seeing project-naming bugs on Save). After **Open…** / load, Save and Save As default from the file leaf / aligned `project.name`; **Untitled** only for **New Project**. Explorer root tracks the file name after Save As.

- **Many `.json` files greyed out in Open / Save As pickers** — **Fixed Jul 20:** Chromium + macOS often typed fresh saves as `text/plain`, so strict `application/json` filters greyed valid `.json` on the **first** Open after Save; second Open worked after Launch Services caught up. Open picker now shows all files (validate `.json` after pick); Save picker accepts `application/json`, `text/json`, and `text/plain`. Quiet-Save handle is released during Open so the file we just saved is not greyed as “already open.”

### Palette

- **Reset Formatting broken** — **Removed July 10** (control deleted from Formatting Palette; was always greyed and unreliable).

- **Font/size dropdown on mixed-format runs** — **Owner smoking Jul 20** (especially after adding or deleting function/field chips in a run). May still show Default Font/Size when the selection mixes faces/sizes, or go false-Mixed / false-default after chip insert/delete. Single-run caret sync and Document typing persistence verified OK July 10. **Smoke focus:** `DESIGNER_DOCUMENT_EDITOR.md` § 7c, 7j (uniform + chip runs; Face→Size with chips; re-drag after click-away).

- **Function placeholder jumps after partial Size change (Jul 20 owner, intermittent)** — Changing font size on **some words** in a paragraph (mixed-size run) can occasionally move a function chip to the wrong place in the same line/paragraph. Easy workaround: drag the chip back (§ 22h). Likely related to Size wrapper split around `contenteditable=false` tokens. Not blocking; track until a reliable repro for fix.

### Document canvas & palette (smoke test July 10)

Owner could not fully test overnight (hooks-order / “too many hooks” error); retested on tip `b48656b` after hard refresh. Font face/size for plain typing OK; remaining Document issues:

- **Backspace deletes function chip then caret vanishes / arrows die** — **Fixed Jul 20.** After Backspace removed a trailing `<<…>>` chip (esp. chip-only placed line), focus often sat after `contenteditable=false` with no ZWSP landing (or selection cleared) → no blinking caret; ArrowLeft appeared dead. Fix: explicit chip Backspace/Delete keeps a live caret landing; `focusPlacedBlock` / `focusPlacedBlockEnd` ensure chip ZWSP pads. **Smoke:** `DESIGNER_DOCUMENT_EDITOR.md` § 22e.

- **Space delete → mid-word wrap; Backspace between paragraphs eats many lines** — **Fixed Jul 20.** (1) `overflow-wrap: break-word` mid-broke glued words after deleting a space (“fashioned” / “names” with room on the line); switched to wrap-at-spaces only. (2) Backspace at start with a blank above now removes **only that blank**; content+content still merges (with a joining space); onInput prune no longer clears every trailing blank invent in one keystroke. **Smoke:** § 22f.

- **✥ drag moves only the first of several selected paragraphs** — **Fixed Jul 20 (superseded):** ✥ anchors **removed** — they snapped back, blocked highlight sizing, and were redundant. Move is **highlight + hand cursor**: select line(s) → grab/grabbing drag moves all selected `.doc-placed-text` together (no pack-to-tight snap-back). **Also Jul 20:** drag into a blank gap above used to bounce back (reflow mid-drag + blank husk collision); now skip pack while `.is-placed-moving` and `finalizePlacedBlocksMove` removes overlapping same-column blanks (parity with Backspace on the blank). **Also Jul 20:** drag-select/move no longer skips a visually middle line that is later in the DOM (fill same-column span + expand Range). **Owner Passed Jul 20.** **Also Jul 20:** double-click / partial word highlight must **not** move the whole paragraph — only whole-line or multi-line selections start highlight-move (`listPlacedBlocksForHighlightMove`). **Smoke:** § 22g.

- **Dragging a placeholder moves the whole paragraph** — **Fixed Jul 20.** Highlight-drag treated a selected field/function chip as a placed-line move (`preventDefault` blocked HTML5 chip drag). Mousedown on a chip no longer starts paragraph move; function chips are relocatable like field tokens. **Owner Passed Jul 20.** **Smoke:** § 22h.

- **Multiline / drag-select highlighting buggy** — **Verified July 10** for plain text: cross-block drag-select works; multi-line align applies to all intersecting placed lines. **Reopened Jul 19 (owner):** drag highlighting still does **not** work properly when the selection includes **Field tokens** and/or **function labels** (`<<…>>`). **Jul 20:** folded into Document caret-model epic (live caret + drag of highlighted content) — see `DESIGNER_OPEN_TODOS.md` § Document caret model. **Related Jul 20:** middle-line skip on plain multi-line select/move fixed (DOM order ≠ visual tops) — **Owner Passed**; chip-inclusive drag-select still open.

- **Cannot drag Function label onto same line as text** — **Owner Passed Jul 20.** Function chips HTML5-relocate like field tokens; drop onto a text line joins it. **Smoke:** § 22h.

- **Long function chips + unreachable MDI chrome (Jul 20 owner)** — Function labels use `white-space: nowrap`, so a long `<<DISPLAY…>>` / MQL chip may **look** wrapped to the next visual line until the Document/Form window is widened (then it snaps back onto its line). Widening (or leaving a wide window) can push **minimize / close** so far right that they are hard or impossible to reach: MDI children **cannot** slide behind **Project Explorer** or **Items/Statements**, but **can** still slide behind **Fields**. Workarounds today: **View** → hide Explorer / Items / Fields, or **Windows → Cascade**. Prior Jul 19 clamp (“keep frame inside `.mdi-surface`”) did not fully solve Fields underlap or title-bar reach after wide chip layout.

- **Cannot rename Form / Process / Document in Explorer** — **Fixed Jul 19:** rename was only a 500ms long-press on an already-selected row (easy to miss, and HTML5 drag canceled it). Now: **click a selected** Form/Process/Document name to edit, or press **F2**. Enter commits, Escape cancels.

- **Cannot rename Process in Explorer (Forms/Documents OK)** — **Fixed Jul 20:** a linked process appears twice (under the form and under **Processes**). Inline rename matched `kind + name`, so both rows entered edit mode; the second input stole focus and blur-cancelled the first. Now matches the unique render `key` so only one `RenameInput` mounts. **Smoke:** select a Post/Pre (or Processes-folder leaf) → click again or F2 → type new name → Enter; Explorer + open window title update.

- **Document rename does not update Process Show / Send / Append** — **Fixed Jul 19:** renaming a Document in Explorer now cascades into Process command refs (`documentRenameCascade.ts` via `renameDocument`), including nested If / ForEach. **Owner Passed Jul 20.**

- **Form rename resizes Document / Form function chips** — **Fixed Jul 20.** Renaming a Form remounts its MDI window; open Documents’ `ResizeObserver` packed layout and **committed**, and commit stripped chip `font-size: 12pt` so chips inherited a larger parent line. Fix: (1) never strip font-size from `.function-token` / `.field-token`; (2) only persist Document reflow when that surface’s **width** changed. Also added **form rename cascade** (`formRenameCascade.ts`) so `Form:Field` refs / function chips update like legacy. **Smoke:** open Document + Form with MQL chips → rename another Form in Explorer → chip sizes and Document layout stay put; rename a referenced Form → chip labels update without growing.

- **Process Connect dialog blocked multi-form Pre/Post** — **Fixed Jul 19:** legacy allows one process on many forms (checklist; Potluck `Show Results`). Dialog was a single-form dropdown/Attach flow. Now Pre and Post **form checklists** (check several forms); banner uses plural “N Forms” when appropriate. **Also:** drag a Process onto a Form in Explorer attaches as **Post-process** when that form’s Post slot is empty (legacy drop).

- **Field rename does not update Functions / function labels** — **Fixed Jul 19:** renaming a Hidden Field, FIB blank alt label, or MCQ field name cascades into Document/Form Text function chips (`data-function-config` + visible `<<NAME(…)>>`), field tokens, and Process command field refs (`fieldRenameCascade.ts` via `updateFormItem`).

- **Function chips insert at random sizes / resize nearby text** — **Fixed Jul 19 (regression):** Form Text still used badge `10px` (Document already inherited). Insert also painted sticky size onto the parent line. Now Form Text chips inherit like Document; insert no longer resizes the paragraph; default insert leaves chip size unset so it matches surrounding text.

- **Ghost / deleted Document text still visible** — **Jul 19 false alarm (owner):** the unexpected question phrasing on Deploy came from **Form Item** MCQ text (Response Totals injects the Form question), not from deleted Document prose. Separately, Design still got a small hardening Jul 19 (discard orphan glyphs after delete; prune stacked duplicate placed lines; missing `reflowPlacedLinesBelow` import) — keep as regression prevention, not as confirmation of that screenshot.

- **Fields and variables font face/size** — **Face/size match verified July 10** after fix. Placement still broken (below).

- **Field token drop/placement on Document** — **Snap-to-line + move-after-drop verified July 10:** drop joins the nearest line; drag relocates an existing token; mid-line drop, typing after token, and joint highlight/reformat with text all work.

- **Font Color selector** — **Verified July 10:** highlight recolors only the selection; **A** applies current color; **▾** chooses a new color; icon swatch tracks color; new typing keeps the color.

- **Alignment tools** — **Verified July 10:** single- and multi-line left/center/right/justify to margins; justify wraps at content width; last line left-aligned.

- **Font size / line packing** — **Verified July 10:** selection-only size; one enlarged word can push lines down; pull-up only when the line box shrinks; reset to default works (mixed highlight shows Mixed, not false default).

- **Can still overwrite existing text without deleting it** — typewriter Return now **pushes** lines below instead of deleting/stacking (**verified July 10**). Owner recheck July 10 afternoon: **no residual overwrite** observed.

- **Empty placed-line husks after delete** — select-all + Delete left an invisible `.doc-placed-text` snap target. **Fixed July 10:** delete/cut/backspace-to-empty prunes husks (Return blank lines kept until deleted).

- **Arrow keys leave Document line / spawn nearby lines** — **Verified July 10:** confine arrows/Home/End in placed lines; Up/Down move between lines (including within soft-wrapped blocks); click on same row snaps into existing line.

### Form canvas (UX backlog)

- **Del/× on selected function chip deletes whole Text row** — **Fixed Jul 20:** highlighting a `<<…>>` function (or field) chip and pressing Del/Backspace, or clicking the row/toolbar **×**, used to remove the entire Text item. Now removes only the selected chip(s); whole-row delete still applies when no chip is highlighted.

- **Design-mode FIB blanks are editable** — should be placeholders / length lines only while editing? **UX bug; deferred.** (Idle Design correctly keeps literal `_` — Batch 2 hold-list Jul 18; boxes only in Preview/Deploy.)

- **Design-mode checkboxes and radios change state** on the canvas. **UX bug; deferred.**

### Hold-list (Jul 18 gated pass)

| Batch | Item | Status |
|-------|------|--------|
| 1 | Form DnD vs text selection (#1 + #10) | **Done** — badge-only reorder (`formItemReorder.ts`); Alt Label `select()` on focus |
| 2 | Design FIB idle keeps `_` (#3) | **Done** — idle paints prompt HTML with underscores |
| 3 | Preview FIB (#4 + #9) | **Done** — `fibPrompt` + runtime; leftAlign keeps interstitial text order |
| 4 | FIB insert highlight (#2) | **Done** — placeholder selected; trailing `_` not |
| 5 | Text indent face/size (#7, #8) | **Done** — `margin-left` indent (no `execCommand("indent")`) |
| 6 | Tables multi-select + overflow (#5, #6) | **Done** — cell selection center; Text wrap `max-height` + scroll |

### Functions (final Designer run-through)

- **Function Where on MCQ fields** — **Implemented Jul 19 (TODO #11).** Function Conditions switches to legacy `mcEquals` / `mcContains` / `mcIsBlank` / … when the left field is an MCQ (`onlyone` → MCOne vs MCMany). Value placeholder = choice letter. FIB Where unchanged. **Owner Passed Jul 20** (non-numeric Where + 2 numeric tests OK).

- **RESPONSE TOTALS multi-select undercount** — **Investigated Jul 19 (TODO #12): no code bug found.** Java + Preview tally both loop all `getValues` / array choices (same as Bar Graph). Added regression tests. **Owner Passed Jul 20** — Totals and Bar Graph both pick up all choices on the same multi-select MCQ.

### Edit / Undo — **closed policy (owner Jul 20)**

**Contract (do not reopen without discussion):** Undo/Redo is **best-effort browser `execCommand`** on the focused contenteditable only. We accept declining returns and will **not** build project-level or full-canvas history now.

| In scope (best effort) | Out of scope (will not undo) |
|------------------------|------------------------------|
| Glyph / format edits while focus stays in **one** Form rich region (Text / FIB / MCQ) or **one** Document surface, if the browser still has a stack | Field name / FIB blank / MCQ name renames |
| | Form item **Label** renames |
| | Document highlight-drag **Moves** of placed lines |
| | Skip / Process statement Add · Modify · delete · reorder |
| | Explorer Form / Process / Document rename; insert/delete items; Save |
| | Cross-item or cross-window Undo; single-MDI-window history stacks |

**Known limits (not bugs to chase):**
- **Document:** placed-line remount / commit churn often leaves Undo empty or useless even for typing.
- **Form:** Undo is **per-item**; leaving that row clears its stack.
- **Skip toolbar** Cut/Copy/Paste/Undo icons remain **stubs** (`DESIGNER_OPEN_TODOS.md` — Deferred UX).
- Legacy Jan 2011 build often had Undo/Redo **always greyed** anyway.

**Past notes (superseded by policy above):** Document Undo “does not work”; field/Label/Moves not on the stack — expected under this contract, not open fix items.

- **Paste required a one-time browser permission prompt** — expected, not a bug: toolbar/menu Paste reads the system clipboard via `navigator.clipboard` (`clipboard-read`), which browsers gate; Cut/Copy write the current selection and are allowed silently. After **Allow**, Paste and ⌘V work without re-prompting. (Fixed Jul 18: Paste now uses the Clipboard API since `execCommand("paste")` is blocked from button clicks.)

### Full build / TypeScript (`npm run build`) — **green Jul 21**

`cd designer-web && npm run build` (`tsc -b` + `vite build`) **passes** as of Jul 21. Cleared unused locals, null/`Element` casts, rename-cascade `FormItem`/`FunctionConfig` typing, and Save-chord `shiftKey` mismatch. No product behavior change intended — typing/cleanup only.

*(Prior inventory Jul 17 had ~14–25 errors across live code + tests; day-to-day Vite still worked throughout.)*

### `.tawala` File → Open — **landed Jul 21**

Legacy projects open via shared `tawalaXmlToJson` (CLI + Designer). Accepts `.json` / `.tawala` / `.tawala.xml`. Import is lossy-with-warnings (pageHeader, styles, rich FIB, invitations, etc.) — see `DESIGNER_OPEN_TODOS.md` week banner and `TAWALA_XML_TO_JSON_MAPPING.md`. After `.tawala` Open, Save As writes format 2.0 `.json` (does not overwrite the legacy file). Prefer imported DirtBowl over corrupted `dirtbowl_definition_v3.json`.

### Skip Instructions

- **Skip dialog: click / edit / delete statement ignored** — **Fixed Jul 19:** Edit Skip Instructions had no select / Modify / line delete (toolbar Delete disabled; Add always appended). Now Process-parity: click a line to edit (Modify), × / toolbar Delete, ↑↓, insert at the arrow (not always append). Also: SkipTo no longer resets the dropdown to the first FIB on open (that made Skip-after-FIB1 look like a no-op).

- **Skip re-edit stuck in Modify-only / cannot add inside If (Jul 20)** — **Fixed Jul 20.** After Close and **Edit** again, selecting a line entered edit mode but the dialog never passed `showAllInsertionGaps`, so the single legacy insert arrow hid and there were **no** clickable gaps — could only Modify existing lines (e.g. could not place a Set inside the If `then` without rebuilding). Now: all insert gaps stay available; clicking a gap clears selection (insert mode); choosing a different Statements palette tool also leaves Modify when it does not match the selected line. **Smoke:** `DESIGNER_FORM_ITEMS_HIDDEN_SKIP_BREAK.md` § Skip re-edit.

- **Skip dialog re-open does not restore insertion point.** Soft leftover; session now also stores `insertIndex` + selection. Re-smoke when convenient.

- **Skip modal overlay quirks** (positioning / full-screen dim). Soft / polish; Close-only dismiss is intentional.

### Process / runtime navigation

- **Process statement: edit vs insert mode (legacy arrow)** — **Fixed Jul 16 (v2):** Selecting a script row enters **edit mode** — solid blue highlight and left **▶** on that statement; insert gap arrow is hidden. Clicking an insert gap / setting insert point clears selection (**insert mode** — ▶ on the separator between lines). Insert hit overlays no longer steal statement clicks (narrower hit band; rows above hits). Smoke: click “Show Form …” → arrow on statement + Modify; click between lines → arrow on gap, no statement highlight.

- **AdminDash start point → empty Thank you; Coach Contact hard to reach after deploy** — **Owner Passed Jul 20 (legacy `.tawala`).** Not a Designer navigation bug. The JSON / open DirtBowl copy was **corrupted** (bare `Show`, blank AdminDashboard). Full legacy `designer-web/public/samples/legacy/DirtBowl.tawala` (dozens of Forms / Processes / Documents) **deployed and worked flawlessly** for the owner Jul 20 — including AdminDash-scale navigation. Truncated `dirtbowl_definition_v3.json` / New Project stubs remain unreliable; use legacy `.tawala` + `deploy-tawala-template.mjs` for DirtBowl smoke.

### Fixed Jul 15 (Signup Sheet smoke — held bugs)

- **MQL Configure column toolbar blank + no tips** — footer +/−/↑/↓ used SVG + native `title` (invisible under modal CSS; tips clipped / absent on disabled). Fixed: glyph buttons + upward `win-tip` tooltips.
- **Signup Sheet submit showed “Registration step complete”** — `renderSubmitAck` DirtBowl copy. Fixed: generic “Thank you” / “Back to {form}” unless Registration.
- **Return to Form 1 kept prior values** — session formFields not cleared. Fixed: append record + `clearFormAnswers` on complete; back link `?fresh=1`.
- **Preview/Deploy lost Form Item spacing** — runtime CSS had no inter-item margins. Fixed: `.tawala-form > …` spacing in `runtime.mjs` page shell (Design canvas unchanged).
- **Signup MQL headers with empty thin rows** — `topLabels` Preview inputs were `readonly` (empty submits → blank records). Fixed: live `blankInput`; skip all-empty `appendFormRecord`.
- **Document injected `Continue →`** — Show Document then Show Form used a separate Continue page. Fixed: stack blank Form under Document on the same response (no Continue artifact).
- **Document MQL config with `<<Field>>` broke parse** — span regex used `[^>]*`. Fixed: quote-aware `htmlSpanReplace.mjs`.
- **Email/Phone validators ignored in Node Preview** — only Registration had checks. Fixed: `fibBlankValidation.mjs` on submit when blank.validation is set.
- **Horizontal FIB layout missing on default/baseball** — vertical spacing only. Fixed: flex rules in `BASE_FORM_CSS`.
- **MQL columns blank despite stored signups** — blanks named `a`/`b`/`c`/`d` with alternateLabel `First`/`Last`/…; MQL asked for `<<Form 1:First>>`. Fixed: `blankAliasesFromForm` at render + append. Also force-restarted API (stale process still injected Continue →).
- **Show Form after Document left prior answers** — `clearFormAnswers` cleared `a`/`b` but not alternateLabel keys (`First`/`Last`), so `blankInput` refilled. Fixed: clear aliases + Form stacks blank.
- **Email/Phone accepted garbage on Signup** — Node Preview skipped validators unless `blank.validation` set. Fixed: infer Email/Tel from name/alternateLabel; reject `..` emails.

## DirtBowl / Registration leftover watchlist (Jul 21 sweep)

Structured pass over `designer-web/` for hard-coded DirtBowl / Registration behavior that can leak into other projects (Potluck, Signup, templates).

### Buckets

| | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **A** | Intentional product support (theme, samples, Registration-only paths) — keep |
| **B** | Registration helpers correctly gated by `formName === "Registration"` / `project.name === "DirtBowl"` / `theme === "dirtbowl2"` — keep; spot-check gates |
| **C** | Runs (or defaults) for **every** project — fix or tighten |

### A — keep

| Location | Notes |
|----------|--------|
| `server/themes/dirtbowl2.css` | Theme CSS |
| `sessionStore.seedDefaultRecords` | Gated `project.name === "DirtBowl"` |
| `registrationLayout.mjs` / `registrationTextToXml.mjs` / `registrationFibToXml.mjs` / `registrationReview*.mjs` | Deploy/Preview Registration chrome; text/FIB XML gated on Registration |
| `jsonToXml` FIB/text paths calling those modules | `formName === "Registration"` |
| Samples / tests / comments mentioning DirtBowl | Docs & fixtures only |
| UI copy (“not DirtBowl participant login”) | Harmless |

### B — keep (gated); light review only

| Location | Gate |
|----------|------|
| Most `runtime.mjs` Registration branches | `isRegistrationForm` (= name `"Registration"`) |
| `Submit →` label | `theme === "dirtbowl2"` |
| `RegStep2` fee rewrite | Form name `RegStep2` |
| Injected `__page2footer__` | Registration + segment 1 |
| `SEND_DOC_DEFAULTS` in `jsonToXml.mjs` | Only when Send body document is a DirtBowl letter name (e.g. `AdminRegNotification`) |

### C — worth fixing (recommended order)

| Pri | Issue | Why | Suggested fix | Status |
|-----|--------|-----|----------------|--------|
| **1** | `applyLegacyPlainTextLeaguePlaceholder` still replaces `""` → `League \|\| "Dirt Bowl"` on **all** plain-text Form items | Any template with literal `""` in Normal text shows “Dirt Bowl”; already burned us on rich HTML | Gate: only Registration **or** only when `League` field exists; else leave `""` alone. Prefer empty/`«League»` over hard-coded Dirt Bowl | **Done Jul 21** — Registration or non-empty `League` only; no hard-coded Dirt Bowl fallback (`runtime.mjs` + Preview tests) |
| **2** | `scrubRegistrationBlankCollisions(session)` runs on **every** `getOrCreateSession` with default form `"Registration"`, and **always deletes** `session.fields.a/b/c` | Signup / any FIB using blank labels `a`/`b`/`c` can lose aliases on session touch | Call scrub only when project has a Registration form (or `project.name === "DirtBowl"`); never wipe bare `a/b/c` for other projects | **Done Jul 21** — `getOrCreateSession` gates on Registration / DirtBowl (`sessionStore.mjs` + scrub tests) |
| **3** | `registrationLayout` fallback `\|\| "Dirt Bowl"` / hard-coded **April 28, 2008** | Only hit for Registration Preview — wrong defaults for a renamed league | Use field value or neutral placeholder (`League` / blank date); leave dated copy in template XML only | Open |
| **4** | `SEND_DOC_DEFAULTS.AdminRegNotification` alias `"Dirt Bowl Automated Email Server"` | Only if that document name is used — still brand-locked | Prefer `aliasField: "AdminName"` or project/League field; or omit aliasLiteral | Open |
| **5** | Error string “still see DirtBowl URLs” in `index.mjs` | Confusing for Potluck deploy failures | Generic “stale Java start URLs” wording | Open |

### Not C (do not “fix” away)

- Comment-only / shape notes (`documentHtmlToXml`, FIB tab stops, Where `Record:Form:Field`).
- Tomcat CSS under `docker/tomcat/css/project/` for dirtbowl2 — Deploy theme, not Designer global.

### Regression rule

Any future Registration-only helper must be gated. Add a **non-DirtBowl** test (Potluck or Signup) when touching Preview/session/XML defaults.

### Pickup Jul 16 — MULTIPLE QUESTION LIST / SignupSheet (owner resume)

**Passed Jul 15 (owner):** MQL table shows stored rows; Document stacks above blank Form 1 (no Continue →); Delete on form items asks “Are you sure?” (blur/Del mishap mitigated).

**Passed / fixed Jul 16 (code + owner smoke where noted):**

| # | Item | Notes |
|---|------|--------|
| 1 | **Horizontal FIB layout** | **Fixed:** Preview/Deploy blank widths from underscore `blank.length` (`size` + `ch`); stacked rows inline (not flex-stretch). Theme CSS in `themes/index.mjs`. |
| 2 | **FIB Required per blank** | **Owner OK.** First click selects item only; second click places caret under the click (`FibCanvasRow`). |
| 3 | **Required / empty submit** | **Owner OK.** `blank.required` blocks empty Submit; validators on Node + Java CSS (`.validateError` in `docker/tomcat/css/project/default.css`). |
| 4 | **MQL Where clause** | **Owner OK.** |
| 5 | **Print / Excel export links** | **Owner OK on Deploy.** Configure toggles persist; Preview emits Print / CSV export (`itemizationPreview.mjs`). |
| 7 | **Java Deploy (8080) parity** | **Owner OK** for Signup Form+MQL path (Tomcat up, `dev`/`dev`). Also: Document MQL field tokens + no nested font/division; FIB multi-blank soft-rows; Design B/I/U→Deploy (`fibRichPromptToXml`). **Re-smoke:** Redeploy after `fcebcfa` to confirm latest FIB formatting on 8080. |
| 8 | **Dev API on 3001 dies** | **Mitigated:** `designer-web/scripts/ensure-dev-api.sh` + README; check `/api/health` when Preview/Deploy fails. |
| 9 | **Session junk rows** | **Mitigated (ops):** cleared stale Java submissions / Preview sessions once; use `?reset=1` or fresh Deploy uniqueId if lists look wrong. |
| — | **FIB Design formatting → Deploy** | **Fixed Jul 16:** freeform prompts mirror B/I/U / face / size / color into Java font XML (`fibToXml` + tests). |

**Still open (leave MQL when these are done or explicitly deferred):**

| # | Item | Notes |
|---|------|--------|
| 6 | **`baseball` theme CSS** | Stub / fallback still weak vs full theme; optional — not blocking Signup default theme. |
| — | **Process caret + row highlight** | **Fixed Jul 16 (v2)** — legacy edit vs insert arrow (see Active bugs). |

**Then:** MQL/SignupSheet core is done enough to leave — continue owner review **#9** other untested functions that already emit Document XML (skip four deferred stubs: Categorizer / Roster / Link / PayPal).

- **Form item Delete had no confirm** — Del/× removed canvas items immediately (easy after FIB Required focus). Fixed Jul 15: `confirmAndDeleteFormItem` + strip/button Del ignore.

## Removed from bugs list (July 10 review)

| Item | Disposition |
|------|-------------|
| Properties: Individual Items stay fully expanded | Moved to **TODOs** (UX polish, not broken) |
| Dev server restart blanks Designer tab | Not a product bug (HMR); dropped |
| Empty MDI until form clicked in Explorer | By design; dropped |
| MDI windows slide under Fields (unreachable close/minimize) | **Partial Jul 19** — drag/resize clamp inside `.mdi-surface`; **reopened Jul 20** — long nowrap chips force wide windows; chrome can still sit under **Fields** / off-reach while Explorer/Items block sliding (see open bugs) |
